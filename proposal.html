    <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
    <h2>What is your website about?</h2>
    <p>
        My Website will be about myself through the lens of my film camera. It will highlight my hobbies, interest,
        profile, people in my life, and most importantly, the vivid memories that I hold.
    </p>
    <h2>What is the objective of your website?</h2>
    <p>
        The objective of my website will be telling the story of my life, my people, my interests, my hobbies through
        the facet of one of my unique skill-sets and passions which is taking film photography. It will serve as a
        segway for people to know me better.
    </p>
    <h2>Who is your target audience?</h2>
    <p>
        My target audience will be my friends, family, and peers who are interested in learning more about me and how my
        interest in photography has navigated the establishment of my greatest memories.
    </p>
    <h2>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website? As you think through your website, please
        remember that the website must have at least 4 pages of content besides the homepage, sitemap, and contact/feedback
        pages.</h2>
    <p>
        The vision that I forsee in this website would be maximizing and embracing my film photography artwork. More
        specifically, I hope to extract this unique aspect of mine to express my love for my family, friends, the
        amazing opportunities I've harvested in life, my travels, my adventures, the scenic landscapes, and somewhat
        transform this project to express gratitude and capture the people, places, and things that have shaped me to be
        who I am today. A breakdown of this website and the snippets of details I would like to touch on in this project proposal is how
        I will use my photos as the touch of excitement. One of the pages will be a kaleidoscope of pictures taken by
        me. Hovering over the pictures will lead to the description of the image. Once the image is clicked on, this
        will lead to the next page which will be the highlights of that memory. I hope that this website will not only
        serve as an appreciation aspect but also remain as a memory recorder to keep track of the people who have come
        into my life leaving an indelible impact. Time in college flies by and everyday there is always something to
        look back and be grateful for, I hope that I can capture as many memories in the past, present, and look forward
        to the incredible things ahead.
