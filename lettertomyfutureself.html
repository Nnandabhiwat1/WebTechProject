    <h1>Letter to My Future Self</h1>
    <p>
        Dear Future Self, <br>
    <div id="first">Wherever you are in place and time I hope that this film photography of yours is still prolonging. I
        hope you are still capturing the faces, places, and moments that uplift you. I hope that your passion has grown
        and you are transcending this knowledge to those around you. I know that when you read this in the near future,
        the nostalgia is rushing over you just know that all you do has paid off and living in the moment at that time
        was worth it.</div>
    <br>
    <div id="second"> The purpose of this website is to showcase the story of my life, my interests, and my hobbies
        through the lens of my unique skill-set and passion for film photography. It will serve as a platform for people
        to get to know me better, with a particular focus on my artwork. Through my photographs, I aim to express my
        gratitude for the people, places, and experiences that have shaped me, including my family, friends, travels,
        adventures, and scenic landscapes. My goal is to create a dynamic and engaging website that captures the essence
        of my life and experiences, both past and present. Ultimately, I hope this website will serve not only
        as a tool for appreciation but also as a kaleidoscope of cherished memories that have shaped me become the
        person I am today. As time in college passes quickly, I am committed to capturing as many memories as possible
        and remaining grateful for the incredible opportunities that lie ahead.</div>

    <br>
    <div id="third"> Although I've had my Pentax camera for some time now, my photography skills have primarily been
        limited to using auto mode and experimenting with point-and-shoot. With the fast-paced nature of high school and
        college, I often found myself needing to quickly hit the shutters without the luxury of manual settings.
        However, I'm excited to challenge myself this summer and slowly transition to taking more manual film photos. I
        believe this will allow me to develop a deeper understanding and appreciation for the intricacies of aperture,
        shutter speed, and focus. As I gain confidence in my ability to capture images with my own hands and skills, I
        know that I'll be able to trust my intuition and create stunning works of art.</div>
    <br>
    <div id="fourth"> Even when the tide turns I know taking photos will always remain my source of expression and
        appreciation. As time goes on I hope to still carry my camera everywhere I go. I'll capture the people, places,
        and times that make me feel whole. So to my future self - get out there, explore what this world holds. Say yes
        to traveling, road trips, and moments you won't be able to rewind. Meet new people and engage in dialogue.
        Invest in friendships and grow meaningful relationships. Reach out and express gratitude to those you are
        grateful for.These snippets of time are unbelievably short so take in those moments so you can relive them like
        they were yesterday.
